## Coming Up

- Writing nice code
- Dictionaries
- Sets
- `None` and `sort()` vs `.sorted()`

:::note[Writing Nice Code]

- ✅ Do
  - Be clear and efficient
  - Write scalable code
    - think "can this code support bigger inputs?"
  - Use loops
  - Abstraction
- ❌ Don't
  - Have lots of repetition

:::

E1. Do the following code snippets do the same thing? What are some advantages and disadvantages of each snippet? What if we needed a hundred different types of tool?

Example A:

```python
print("We need some saws")
print("We need some hammers")
print("We need some cogs")
print("We need some nails")
```

Example B:

```python
def get_str(part):
    return f"We need some {part}"
print(get_str("saws"))
print(get_str("hammers"))
print(get_str("cogs"))
print(get_str("nails"))
```

Example C:

```python
def get_str(part):
    return f"We need some {part}"
parts = ("saws", "hammers", "cogs", "nails")
for part in parts:
    print(get_str(part))
```

E2. Consider the following while loop and two conversions to for loops. Are the two for loops equivalent? Why might you choose one over the other?

Original While Loop:

```python
count = 0
items = ('eggs', 'spam', 'more eggs')
while count < len(items):
    print(f"we need to buy more {items[count]}")
    count += 1
```

For Loop A:

```python
items = ('eggs', 'spam', 'more eggs')
for count in range(len(items)):
    print(f"we need to buy more {items[count]}")
```

For Loop B:

```python
items = ('eggs', 'spam', 'more eggs')
for item in items:
    print(f"we need to buy more {item}")
```

:::note[Dictionary Operations]

- Accessing
  - `d[key]` access value associated to key - returns `KeyError` if key doesn't exist
  - `d.get(key)` returns value associated with key - returns `None` if key doesn't exist
  - `key in d` test for presence of key
- Adding
  - `d[new_key] = new_value` adding a new key
  - `d.copy()` makes a shallow copy of dictionary
- Deleting
  - `d.pop(key)` deletes key-value pair
  - `del d[key]` deletes key-value pair
  - `d.clear()` deletes all key-value pairs from the dictionary
- Iterables
  - `d.keys()` returns iterable collection of keys
  - `d.values()` returns iterable collection of values
  - `d.items()` returns iterable collection of 2-tuples (key, value)
  - `list(d)` same as `list(d.keys())`

<PyCode isRunnable>

```python
d = {
    "name": "Jane",
    "hobbies": ["coding", "basketball"]
}
print(f"Original dictionary: {d}\n")

print(list(d.items())[0])

for item in d.items():
    print(item)


# # adding a new key
# d["age"] = 30
# print(f"After adding new key: {d}\n")

# # updating existing key
# d["name"] = "Alex"
# d["hobbies"].append("reading")
# print(f"After updating: {d}\n")

# # deleting
# pop_return = d.pop("hobbies")
# print(f'pop_return: {pop_return}')
# del d["name"]
# print(f"After deletions: {d}")

```

D2. What is the difference between using the .pop() method on a dictionary and using it on a list?

## Sets

:::note[Set Operations]

![](/assets/comp10001/w6.excalidraw.png)

:::

D3. In what situations would we use a "set"? How does it differ from other "containers" such as lists and dictionaries?

<PyCode>

```
You can type your answer to D3 here...
```

</PyCode>

D4. What special operations can we perform on sets? How do we add and remove items from them?

<PyCode>

```
You can type your answer to D4 here...
```

</PyCode>

E3. Evaluate the following given the assignment `d = {"R": 0, "G": 255, "B": 0, "other": {"opacity": 0.6}}`. Specify whether the value of d changes as a result. Assume d is reset to its original value each time.

<PyCode>

```
You can type your answer to E3 here...

(a) `"R"in d`

(b) `d["R"]`

(c) `d["R"] = 255`

(d) `d["A"]`

(e) `d["A"] = 50`

(f) `d.pop("G")`

(g) `d["other"]["blur"] = 0.1`

(h) `d.items()`
```

</PyCode>

E4. Evaluate the following given the assignment `s1 = {1, 2, 4}` and `s2 = {3, 4, 5}`. If s1 or s2 change as a result, give their new value. Assume s1 and s2 are reset to their original values each time.

<PyCode>

```
You can type your answer to E4 here...

(a) `s1.add(7)`

(b) `s1.add(2)`

(c) `s2.remove(5)`

(d) `s1 & s2`

(e) `s1.union(s2)`

(f) `s1 - s2`
```

</PyCode>

## Coding Problems

### Problem 1

Write a function which takes a string as input and prints the frequency of each character in the string using a dictionary. `freq_counts('booboo')` should print:

```
b 2
o 4
```

<PyCode isRunnable>

```

```

</PyCode>

### Problem 2

Write a function which takes two lists as input and returns a list containing the numbers which they both have in common. `in_common([1, 2, 4], [3, 4, 5])` should return `[4]`.

<PyCode isRunnable>

```

```

</PyCode>

### Problem 3

Write a function which takes a dictionary and returns a sorted list containing the unique values in that dictionary. `unique_values({'a': 1, 'b': 0, 'c': 0})` should return `[0, 1]`.

<PyCode isRunnable>

```

```

</PyCode>

### Problem 4

Write a function which takes a string, a character and an integer threshold and returns True if the character appears in the string with a frequency above the threshold, False if it appears at or below the threshold, and None if it doesn’t appear at all. `above_thresh('I like the letter e', 'e', 3)` should return `True`.

<PyCode isRunnable>

```

```

</PyCode>
