## Code Commeting and Documentation

D1. Why is it important to write comments for the code we write? Wouldn’t it save time, storage space and processing time to write code without comments?

<PyCode>

```
You can type your answer to D1 here...
```

</PyCode>

D2. What is a docstring? What is its purpose?

<PyCode>

```
You can type your answer to D2 here...
```

</PyCode>

:::note[Docstrings]

- Ways to structure docstrings

  - short and sweet one-liners

    - example:
      ```python
      def multiplier(a, b):
          """Takes in two numbers, returns their product."""
          return a*b
      ```

  - detailed params/args, returns, raises, example

    - examples:

      ```python
      def add_binary(a, b):
          """
          Returns the sum of two decimal numbers in binary digits.

          Parameters
          ----------
          a (int): A decimal integer
          b (int): Another decimal integer

          Returns
          -------
          binary_sum (str): Binary string of the sum of a and b
          """
          #...
      ```

```python
def multiplier(a, b):
    """Takes in two numbers, returns their product."""
    return a*b
print(help(print))
```

E1. Fill in the blanks with comments and a docstring for the following function, which ﬁnds the most popular
animals by counting ballots. An example for ballots is `['dog', 'pig', 'cat', 'pig', 'dog']`,
in which case the function returns `['dog', 'pig']`. There’s no deﬁnite right or wrong answer here,
try to develop your own style.

<PyCode>

```python
def favourite_animal(ballots):
    """ ... """
    tally = {}

    # ...
    for animal in ballots:
        if animal in tally:
            tally[animal] += 1
        else:
            tally[animal] = 1
    # ...
    most_votes = max(tally.values())
    favourites = []
    for animal, votes in tally.items():
        if votes == most_votes:
            favourites.append(animal)
    return favourites
```

## Variable Names and Global Constants

D3. How should we choose variable names? How do good variable names add to the readability of code?

<PyCode>

```
You can type your answer to D3 here...
```

</PyCode>

D4. What are magic numbers? How do we write code without them by using global constants?

<PyCode>

```
You can type your answer to D4 here...
```

</PyCode>

E2. Consider the following programs. What are the problematic aspects of their variable names and use of magic numbers? What improvements would you make to improve readability?

```python
a = float(input("Enter days: "))
b = a * 24
c = b * 60
d = c * 60
print("There are", b, "hours", c, "minutes,", d, "seconds in", a, "days")
```

```python
word = input("Enter text: ")
x = 0
vowels = 0
word_2 = word.split()
for word_3 in word_2:
    x += 1
    for word_4 in word_3:
        if word_4.lower() in "aeiou":
            vowels += 1
if vowels/x > 0.4:
    print("Above threshold")
```

    for i in range(len(grid)):
        for j in range(len(grid[0])):
            new_grid[i][j] = 1 - grid[i][j]
            print(new_grid)
    return new_grid

grid = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]

## Timely Returns

E6. Compare the two functions below. Are they equivalent? Why would we prefer one over the other?

```python
def noletter_1(words, letter='z'):
    for word in words:
        if letter in word:
            return False
    return True
def noletter_2(words, letter='z'):
    no_z = True
    for word in words:
        if letter in word:
            no_z = False
    return no_z

wordlist = ['zizzer'] + ['aardvark'] * 1_000_000
print(noletter_1(wordlist))
print(noletter_2(wordlist))
```

## Problems

### Problem 1

Write a function which takes a list of words and checks whether any of those words are palindromes
(spelled the same way backwards as forwards, like “hannah”). It should return True if there are any
palindromes and False if there are none. Use a timely return to save some time!
`any_palindrome(['hannah', 'sven', 'mei'])` should return True.

<PyCode isRunnable>

```python
def any_palindrome(words):
    #...
print(any_palindrome(['hannah', 'sven', 'mei']))
```

</PyCode>

### Problem 2

Write a function which takes a list of lists of integers and returns a sorted list containing the unique num-
bers. For example `unique_2d_list([[1, 5, 3], [2], [5, 1, 2]])` should return `[1, 2, 3, 5]`.

<PyCode isRunnable>

```python
def unique_2d_list(list_2d):
    #...
print(unique_2d_list([[1, 5, 3], [2], [5, 1, 2]]))
```

</PyCode>

### Problem 3

Write a function which takes a string and returns a 2-tuple containing the most common character in the
string and its frequency. In the case of a tie, it should return the character which occurs ﬁrst in the text.
`most_common_char('hi there')` should return `('h', 2)`.

<PyCode isRunnable>

```python
def most_common_char(text):
    #...
```

</PyCode>
