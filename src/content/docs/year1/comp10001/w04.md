2. Sequences, Indexing and Slicing
3. Functions

## 1 Booleans, Relational and Logic Operators, and Conditionals

### Discussion 1: Booleans

D1: What is ‚ÄúBoolean‚Äù? What values does it store? Can other types be converted to it?

{% pycode %}

```
# ints -> bool
# print(bool(0))  # 0 converts to False
# print(bool(1))  # all other values convert to True

# floats -> bool
# print(bool(0.0))    # 0.0 converts to False
# print(bool(3.1415)) # all other values convert to True

# str -> bool
# print(bool(""))     # empty string converts to False
# print(bool(" "))    # all other values convert to True
# print(bool("Hi!"))  # all other values convert to True
```

{% /pycode %}

### Discussion 2: Relational and Logical Operators

D2: For each of the following, identify whether it is: (a) a Boolean value; (b) a relational operator; or (c) a logical operator.

1. `==`:
2. `!=`:
3. `or`:
4. `True`:
5. `>`:
6. `and`:
7. `>=`:
8. `<`:
9. `False`:
10. `<=`:
11. `not`:

#### üìù Operators

- the following is ordered from **Highest to Lowest precedence**
- Arithmetic Operators
  - `()` brackets
  - `**` exponent
  - `%` modulus/remainder
  - `//` floor/integer division
  - `/` division
  - `*` multiplication
  - `-` subtraction (also a unary operator; make number negative)
  - `+` addition (also a unary operator; make number positive)
- Relational Operators
  - _compare two values to produce a truth (boolean) result_
  - `==` equal to
  - `!=` not equal to
  - `<` less than
  - `>` greater than
  - `<=` less than or equal to
  - `>=` more than or equal to
  - `in`
- Logical Operators
  - _combine Boolean values to return a single truth value_
  - `not`
  - `and`
  - `or`

### Discussion 3: Conditionals

D3: How do we use an if statement? What are the variants? How do we know what is contained inside it and what is after?

#### üìù if...elif...else Structure

```python
if <condition_1>:
  <statements/operations to be executed if condition1 is True>
elif <condition_2>:
  <statements/operations to be executed if condition2 is True>
...
elif <condition_x>:
  <statements/operations to be executed if conditionx is True>
else:
  <statements/operations to be executed if all conditions are False>
```

### Exercise 1

E1: Evaluate the following truth expressions:

1. `True or False`:
2. `True and False`:
3. `False and not False or True`:
4. `False and (not False or True)`:

### üìù Logical Operator Truth Tables

| a     | b     | a and b | a or b |
| ----- | ----- | ------- | ------ |
| False | False | False   | False  |
| False | True  | False   | True   |
| True  | False | False   | True   |
| True  | True  | True    | True   |

| a     | not a |
| ----- | ----- |
| False | True  |
| True  | False |

### Exercise 2

E2: For each of the following if statements, give an example of a value for var which will trigger it and one which will not.

1. ## `if 10 > var >= 5:`
2. ## `if var[0] == "A"and var[-1] == "e":`
3. ## `if var in ["VIC", "NSW", "ACT"]:`
4. ## `if var:`

### Exercise 3

E3: What‚Äôs wrong with this code? How can you Ô¨Åx it?
{% pycode %}

```
letter = input("Enter a letter: ")
if letter == 'a' or 'e' or 'i' or 'o' or 'u':
    print("vowel")
else:
    print("consonant")
```

{% /pycode %}

### Exercise 4 (assignment VS equality)

E4: What‚Äôs wrong with this code? How can you Ô¨Åx it?
{% pycode %}

```
eggs == 3
if eggs = 5:
    print("spam")
else:
    print("not spam")
```

{% /pycode %}

## 2 Sequences, Indexing and Slicing

### Discussion 4: Sequences

D4: What is a ‚ÄúSequence‚Äù? What sequences have we seen so far? What operators can we use with sequences?

#### üìù Sequence Operations

{% pycode %}

```
# Create copies of sequences with *
# print("hello"*2)
# print(("python", 2, [1, 2])*4)  # tuples and lists are sequences too (later)

# Concatenate sequences with +
# print("good " + "afternoon")

# Use for...in... to loop through sequences (later)
# for letter in "awesome":
#     print(letter)
```

{% /pycode %}

### Discussion 5: Indexing

D5: What is indexing? How can you do it?

### Dicussion 6: Slicing

D6: What is slicing? How can you do it?

### Exercise 5

|                | p   | y   | t   | h   | o   | n   |
| -------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| index          | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   |
| negative index | -6  | -5  | -4  | -3  | -2  | -1  |

- length: 6
- Slicing: `[start:end:step]`

E5: Evaluate the following given the assignment s = "python"

1. `s[1]`:
2. `s[-1]`:
3. `s[1:3] + s[3:5]`:
4. `s[10]`:
5. `s[10:]`:
6. `s[-4:-2]`:
7. `s[:-4]`:
8. `s[::2]`:
9. `s[::-1]`:

{% pycode %}

```
# only use the code block for checking your answers!
```

{% /pycode %}

## 3 Functions

### Discussion 7: Functions

D7: What is a ‚Äúfunction‚Äù? How do we call (use) one? How do we deÔ¨Åne one ourselves?

#### üìù Function (and Docstring) Structure

```python
CONSTANT = 0 # declare constants before all functions
def <function-name>(<parameters>):
    """
    docstring describing what the function does.
    """
    <function-body>
```

{% pycode %}

```
def sum(x, y):
    """Returns the sum of two integers."""
    return x + y

sum(1, 2)   # function call
# print(sum(1, 2))    # printing the returned value

# Viewing Docstrings
# print(sum.__doc__)
# print(print.__doc__)  # built-in functions also have docstrings
```

{% /pycode %}

- Ways to structure docstrings

  - short and sweet one-liners

    - example:
      ```python
      def multiplier(a, b):
          """Takes in two numbers, returns their product."""
          return a*b
      ```

  - detailed params/args, returns, raises, example

    - examples:

      ```python
      def add_binary(a, b):
          """
          Returns the sum of two decimal numbers in binary digits.

          Parameters
          ----------
          a (int): A decimal integer
          b (int): Another decimal integer

          Returns
          -------
          binary_sum (str): Binary string of the sum of a and b
          """
          #...
      ```

### Discussion 8: Return

D8: What does it mean to ‚Äúreturn‚Äù a value from a function and why would we want to? Does a function always need a return value?

{% pycode %}

```
def example_1():
    return 1
    print("abc")
    return 2
    return 3

print(example_1)    # what do you think this will return?
```

{% /pycode %}

### Discussion 9: Function of Functions

D9: Why should we use functions? Could we live without functions?

### Discussion 10: Brackets and Functions

D10: Why are brackets important when calling a function? Are they needed even if it takes no arguments?

### Exercise 6

E6: What‚Äôs wrong with this code? How can you Ô¨Åx it?
{% pycode %}

```
def calc(n1, n2):
    answer = n1 + (n1 * n2)
    print(answer)

num = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
result = calc(2, num)
print("The result is:", result)
```

{% /pycode %}

## Coding Problems

### Problem 1

{% pycode %}

```
"""
P1: Write a function which takes a string as a single argument, and returns a
shortened version of the string consisting of its Ô¨Årst three letters and then
every second letter in the rest of the word. shorten('uncalled') should return
'uncle'.
"""


```

{% /pycode %}

### Problem 2

{% pycode %}

```
"""
P2: Write a function which takes a sentence as a single argument (in the form of
a string), and evaluates whether it is valid based on whether the Ô¨Årst letter is
capitalised and the last character is a full stop. It should return a Boolean
value True or False.
"""


```

{% /pycode %}

### Problem 3

{% pycode %}

```
"""
P3: Write a program which asks the user for two numbers and an operator out of
+, -, / and * and performs that operation on the two numbers, printing the
result.
"""


```
