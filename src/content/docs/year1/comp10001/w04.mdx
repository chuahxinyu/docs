2. Sequences, Indexing and Slicing
3. Functions

## Booleans, Relational and Logic Operators, and Conditionals

D1: What is “Boolean”? What values does it store? Can other types be converted to it?

<PyCode isRunnable>

```
# ints -> bool
# print(bool(0))  # 0 converts to False
# print(bool(1))  # all other values convert to True

# floats -> bool
# print(bool(0.0))    # 0.0 converts to False
# print(bool(3.1415)) # all other values convert to True

# str -> bool
# print(bool(""))     # empty string converts to False
# print(bool(" "))    # all other values convert to True
# print(bool("Hi!"))  # all other values convert to True
```

</PyCode>

:::note[Operators]

- the following is ordered from **Highest to Lowest precedence**
- Arithmetic Operators
  - `()` brackets
  - `**` exponent
  - `%` modulus/remainder
  - `//` floor/integer division
  - `/` division
  - `*` multiplication
  - `-` subtraction (also a unary operator; make number negative)
  - `+` addition (also a unary operator; make number positive)
- Relational Operators
  - _compare two values to produce a truth (boolean) result_
  - `==` equal to
  - `!=` not equal to
  - `<` less than
  - `>` greater than
  - `<=` less than or equal to
  - `>=` more than or equal to
  - `in`
- Logical Operators
  - _combine Boolean values to return a single truth value_
  - `not`
  - `and`
  - `or`

:::

E3: What’s wrong with this code? How can you ﬁx it?

<PyCode isRunnable>

```
letter = input("Enter a letter: ")
if letter == 'a' or 'e' or 'i' or 'o' or 'u':

    print("not spam")
```

</PyCode>

## Sequences, Indexing and Slicing

:::note[Sequence Operations]

<PyCode isRunnable>

```
# Create copies of sequences with *
# print("hello"*2)
# print(("python", 2, [1, 2])*4)  # tuples and lists are sequences too (later)

# Concatenate sequences with +
# print("good " + "afternoon")

# Use for...in... to loop through sequences (later)
# for letter in "awesome":
#     print(letter)
```

</PyCode>

<PyCode isRunnable>

# only use the code block for checking your answers!
```

## Functions

D7: What is a “function”? How do we call (use) one? How do we deﬁne one ourselves?

<PyCode>

```
You can type your answer to D7 here...
```

</PyCode>

:::note[Function (and Docstring) Structure]

```python
CONSTANT = 0 # declare constants before all functions
def <function-name>(<parameters>):
    """
    docstring describing what the function does.
    """
    <function-body>
```

<PyCode isRunnable>

```
def sum(x, y):
    """Returns the sum of two integers."""
    return x + y

sum(1, 2)   # function call
# print(sum(1, 2))    # printing the returned value

# Viewing Docstrings
# print(sum.__doc__)
# print(print.__doc__)  # built-in functions also have docstrings
```

</PyCode>

- Ways to structure docstrings

  - short and sweet one-liners

    - example:
      ```python
      def multiplier(a, b):
          """Takes in two numbers, returns their product."""
          return a*b
      ```

  - detailed params/args, returns, raises, example

    - examples:

      ```python
      def add_binary(a, b):
          """
          Returns the sum of two decimal numbers in binary digits.

          Parameters
          ----------
          a (int): A decimal integer
          b (int): Another decimal integer

          Returns
          -------
          binary_sum (str): Binary string of the sum of a and b
          """
          #...

D8: What does it mean to “return” a value from a function and why would we want to? Does a function always need a return value?

<PyCode isRunnable>

```
def example_1():
    return 1
    print("abc")
    return 2
    return 3

print(example_1)    # what do you think this will return?
```

</PyCode>

D9: Why should we use functions? Could we live without functions?

<PyCode>

```
You can type your answer to D9 here...
```

</PyCode>

D10: Why are brackets important when calling a function? Are they needed even if it takes no arguments?

<PyCode>

```
You can type your answer to D10 here...
```

</PyCode>

E6: What’s wrong with this code? How can you ﬁx it?

<PyCode isRunnable>

```
def calc(n1, n2):
    answer = n1 + (n1 * n2)
    print(answer)

num = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
result = calc(2, num)
print("The result is:", result)
```

## Coding Problems

### Problem 1

<PyCode isRunnable>

```
"""
P1: Write a function which takes a string as a single argument, and returns a
shortened version of the string consisting of its ﬁrst three letters and then
every second letter in the rest of the word. shorten('uncalled') should return
'uncle'.
"""


```

</PyCode>

### Problem 2

<PyCode isRunnable>

```
"""
P2: Write a function which takes a sentence as a single argument (in the form of
a string), and evaluates whether it is valid based on whether the ﬁrst letter is
capitalised and the last character is a full stop. It should return a Boolean
value True or False.
"""


```

</PyCode>

### Problem 3

<PyCode isRunnable>

```
"""
P3: Write a program which asks the user for two numbers and an operator out of
+, -, / and * and performs that operation on the two numbers, printing the
result.
"""


```
