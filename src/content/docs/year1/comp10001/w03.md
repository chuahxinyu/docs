Above are some data types that we'll be learning in COMP10001. Highlighted are what we've learnt from the lectures so far. Python offers many more built-in data types that can be explored [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html).

{% pycode %}

### String Operations, Functions and Methods

{% pycode %}

```python
# print("Hello")
# input("Please enter some input: ")
# print(len("Hello"))
# print("Hello"[1:3]) # string slicing
# print("Hello"[4]) # string indexing
# print("HELLO".lower()) # .lower() method
# print("hello".upper()) # .upper() method
```

{% /pycode %}

```python
# print(type(123))
# print(1 + 1) #quickmaths
# print(1 // 2) # integer division rounds down

# print(type(3.1415))
# print(1 + 1.0) # int + float = float
# print(1 / 1) # int / int = float (division creates floats)

# print(type(True))
# print(bool("")) # empty string
# print(bool(" ")) # non-empty string
# print(bool())
```

{% /pycode %}

### Discussion 1

D1. What is a "data type"? Can the data type of an object change?

{% pycode isRunnable=false %}

```python
You can type your answer to D1 here...
```

{% /pycode %}

### Discussion 2

D2: As a class, Ô¨Åll in the below table with the data types we have studied so far. What is the difference between the second and third type, both being numerical?
|Type|Example|What does it store?|What can we do with it (functions, operations...)?|How do we convert to it?|
|--|--|--|--|--|
||`"Hello"`||||
||`123`||||
||`3.1415`||||
||`True`||||

{% pycode isRunnable=false %}

```python
You can type your answer to D2 here...
```

{% /pycode %}

### Exercise 1

E1. Look at the following customer data form, and decide which data types (str, int, float, or bool) should be used to store each field.

{% pycode isRunnable=false %}

```python
You can type your answer to E1 here...

- Name:
- Customer ID:
- Address:
- Postcode:
- Do you own or rent?:
- Length of bench top:
- Width of bench top:
- Are you interested in further offers?:
```

{% /pycode %}

### Exercise 2

E2. Evaluate the following

{% pycode isRunnable=false %}

```python
You can type your answer to E2 here...

1. `str(3 + 4) + "cakes"`
2. `int(5/2)`
3. `float("357"+ "."+ "23")`
4. `bool("anything")`

```

{% /pycode %}

## Arithmetic Operators

### Discussion 3: Operators

{% toast type="col-detail" summary="Arithmetic Operators" %}

> We'll be learning more about Operators in in [Week 4](w04.md)

![](/assets/comp10001/operator.excalidraw.png)

- Arithmetic Operators (from Highest to Lowest precedence)
  - `()` brackets
  - `**` exponent
  - `%` modulus/remainder
  - `//` floor/integer division
  - `/` division
  - `*` multiplication
  - `-` subtraction (also a unary operator; make number negative)
  - `+` addition (also a unary operator; make number positive)

{% /toast %}

D3. What is an ‚Äúoperator‚Äù? Which operators have we
learned so far and what do they do?

{% pycode isRunnable=false %}

```python
You can type your answer to D3 here...
```

{% /pycode %}

### Discussion 4: Operator Overloading

{% toast type="col-detail" summary="Operator Overloading Example" %}
{% pycode %}

```
# Example of Operator Overloading
print(1 + 1) # int + int
print("1" + "1") # str + str
# print("1" + 1) # str + int -- what do you think this will do? ü§î
```

{% /pycode %}
{% /toast %}

D4. What is ‚Äúoperator overloading‚Äù? What is the difference between using + with numerical types and strings/sequences?

{% pycode isRunnable=false %}

```python
You can type your answer to D3 here...
```

{% /pycode %}

## Variables

### Discussion 5

D5. What is a ‚Äúvariable‚Äù? How do we use variables and why are they helpful?

{% pycode isRunnable=false %}

```
You can type your answer to D5 here...
```

{% /pycode %}

### Exercise 3

E3. Evaluate the following given the assignments a = 1, b = 2, c = 2.0:

{% pycode isRunnable=false %}

```python

1. `a / a`
2. `b + b`
3. `b + c`
4. `a / b`
5. `a // b`
6. `a % b`
7. `a + b / c`
8. `(a + b) / c`
```

{% /pycode %}

### Exercise 4

E4. What is the output of the following? Why?

{% pycode isRunnable=false %}

```
You can type your answer to E4 here...
1. `123 + 123`
2. `"123" + "123"`
3. `"123" + 123`
4. `3 * 4`
5. `"3" * 4`
6. `"3" * "4"`
```

{% /pycode %}

## Extra Questions

### Extra Question 6: input()

EQ6. How does the `input()` function work?

{% pycode isRunnable=false %}

```
You can type your answer to EQ6 here...
```

{% /pycode %}

### Extra Question 7: Literals

EQ7. What is a literal?

{% pycode isRunnable=false %}

```
You can type your answer to EQ7 here...
```

{% /pycode %}

### Extra Question 8: Floating Point Error

EQ8. Why does 0.1+0.1+0.1+0.1+0.1+0.1+0.1+0.1+0.1+0.1 equal 0.9999999999999999 and not 1.0?

{% toast type="col-detail" summary="Floating Point Error Code Example" %}

{% pycode %}

```python
# Discussion 8: Floating Point Error
# print(0.1+0.1+0.1+0.1+0.1+0.1+0.1+0.1+0.1+0.1)
print(1.2 - 1.0) # what do you expect the answer to be?

# print(((1.2 * 10) - (1.0 * 10)) / 10) # Solution 1: turn the floats to whole numbers
```

{% /pycode %}

{% /toast %}

{% pycode isRunnable=false %}

```
You can type your answer to EQ8 here...
```

{% /pycode %}

## Problems

### Problem 1

{% pycode %}

```
"""
P1: Write a program which asks the user for their age and calculates the year in
which they were born. There will be two possibilities since you haven‚Äôt asked
for their birth date, so print both.
"""
```

{% /pycode %}

### Problem 2

{% pycode %}

```
"""
P2: Write a program which asks the user for two integers and multiplies them
together, printing the equation in the form 1 * 2 = 2 for the case of 1 and 2.
"""
```

{% /pycode %}

### Problem 3

{% pycode %}

```
"""
P3: Write a program which asks the user for a temperature in degrees Fahrenheit and
prints the corresponding value in Celsius. The conversion formula is below:
    C = (F - 32) / 1.8
"""
```
