Above are some data types that we'll be learning in COMP10001. Highlighted are what we've learnt from the lectures so far. Python offers many more built-in data types that can be explored [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html).

### String Operations, Functions and Methods

<PyCode isRunnable={true}>

```python
print("Hello")

example_input = input("Please enter some input: ")
print("Your input was" + example_input)

# üóØÔ∏è Uncomment the lines below and try them out!
# print(len("Hello"))
# print("Hello"[1:3]) # string slicing
# print("Hello"[4]) # string indexing
# print("HELLO".lower()) # .lower() method
# print("hello".upper()) # .upper() method
```

</PyCode>

D1. What is a "data type"? Can the data type of an object change?

<PyCode>

```
You can type your answer to D1 here...
```

</PyCode>

D2: As a class, Ô¨Åll in the below table with the data types we have studied so far. What is the difference between the second and third type, both being numerical?
|Type|Example|What does it store?|What can we do with it (functions, operations...)?|How do we convert to it?|
|--|--|--|--|--|
||`"Hello"`||||
||`123`||||
||`3.1415`||||
||`True`||||

<PyCode>

```
You can type your answer to D2 here...
```

</PyCode>

E1. Look at the following customer data form, and decide which data types (str, int, float, or bool) should be used to store each field.

<PyCode>

```python
You can type your answer to E1 here...

- Name:
- Customer ID:
- Address:
- Postcode:
- Do you own or rent?:
- Length of bench top:
- Width of bench top:
- Are you interested in further offers?:
```

</PyCode>

E2. Evaluate the following

<PyCode>

```
You can type your answer to E2 here...

1. `str(3 + 4) + "cakes"`
2. `int(5/2)`
3. `float("357"+ "."+ "23")`
4. `bool("anything")`
```

</PyCode>

## Arithmetic Operators

:::note[Operators]

> We'll be learning more about Operators in in [Week 4](w4)

![](/assets/comp10001/operator.excalidraw.png)

- Arithmetic Operators (from Highest to Lowest precedence)
  - `()` brackets
  - `**` exponent
  - `%` modulus/remainder
  - `//` floor/integer division
  - `/` division
  - `*` multiplication
  - `-` subtraction (also a unary operator; make number negative)
  - `+` addition (also a unary operator; make number positive)

D3. What is an ‚Äúoperator‚Äù? Which operators have we
learned so far and what do they do?

<PyCode>

```python
You can type your answer to D3 here...
```

</PyCode>

D4. What is ‚Äúoperator overloading‚Äù? What is the difference between using + with numerical types and strings/sequences?

<PyCode>

```python
You can type your answer to D4 here...
```

</PyCode>

:::tip[Operator Overloading]

Here's an example of operator overloading:

<PyCode isRunnable>

```python
# Example of Operator Overloading
print(1 + 1) # int + int
print("1" + "1") # str + str
# print("1" + 1) # str + int -- what do you think this will do? ü§î
```

</PyCode>

:::

## Variables

D5. What is a ‚Äúvariable‚Äù? How do we use variables and why are they helpful?

<PyCode>

```
You can type your answer to D5 here...
```

</PyCode>

E3. Evaluate the following given the assignments a = 1, b = 2, c = 2.0:

<PyCode>

```
You can type your answer to E3 here...

1. `a / a`
2. `b + b`
3. `b + c`
4. `a / b`
5. `a // b`
6. `a % b`
7. `a + b / c`
8. `(a + b) / c`
```

</PyCode>

E4. What is the output of the following? Why?

<PyCode>

```
You can type your answer to E4 here...

1. `123 + 123`
2. `"123" + "123"`
3. `"123" + 123`
4. `3 * 4`
5. `"3" * 4`
6. `"3" * "4"`
```

</PyCode>

## Extra Questions

EQ6. How does the `input()` function work?

<PyCode>

```
You can type your answer to EQ6 here...
```

</PyCode>

EQ7. What is a literal?

<PyCode>

```
You can type your answer to EQ7 here...
```

</PyCode>

EQ8. Why does 0.1+0.1+0.1+0.1+0.1+0.1+0.1+0.1+0.1+0.1 equal 0.9999999999999999 and not 1.0?

<PyCode>

```
You can type your answer to EQ8 here...
```

</PyCode>

:::tip[Floating Point Error]

Here's an example of floating point error:

<PyCode isRunnable>

```python
# Discussion 8: Floating Point Error
# print(0.1+0.1+0.1+0.1+0.1+0.1+0.1+0.1+0.1+0.1)
print(1.2 - 1.0) # what do you expect the answer to be?

# print(((1.2 * 10) - (1.0 * 10)) / 10) # Solution 1: turn the floats to whole numbers
```

</PyCode>

## Problems

### Problem 1

<PyCode isRunnable>

```
"""
P1: Write a program which asks the user for their age and calculates the year in
which they were born. There will be two possibilities since you haven‚Äôt asked
for their birth date, so print both.
"""
```

</PyCode>

### Problem 2

<PyCode isRunnable>

```
"""
P2: Write a program which asks the user for two integers and multiplies them
together, printing the equation in the form 1 * 2 = 2 for the case of 1 and 2.
"""
```

</PyCode>

### Problem 3

<PyCode isRunnable>

```
"""
P3: Write a program which asks the user for a temperature in degrees Fahrenheit and
prints the corresponding value in Celsius. The conversion formula is below:
    C = (F - 32) / 1.8
"""
```

</PyCode>
