## Forces
### What is dynamics?
- the study of how forces affect the motion of objects
### What is a force?
- a *push* or a *pull* on an object with a specific magnitude and direction; can be represented by vectors; can be expressed as a multiple of a standard force
### What is an external force?
- any outside forces that act on a body
### What is a free-body diagram?
- a drawing of all external forces acting on a body

## Newton I - Law of Inertia
- a body at rest remains at rest, or, if in motion, remains in motion at a constant velocity unless acted on by a net external force
- The *net force* is the vector sum of all the forces acting on an object
### What is inertia?
- the *tendency* of an object to **remain** at rest or **remain** in motion
- related to an object's **mass**
### What is mass?
- the *quantity of matter* in a substance

## Newton II - Acceleration is due to forces
- $\boxed{F_{net}=ma}$
  - $F_{net}$ = net force = cause
  - $m$ = mass
  - $a$ = acceleration = effect
- An object subject to a net force will accelerate in the direction of the net force at a rate proportional to the force and inversely proportional to the object's mass

## Newton III - Action/Reaction
- For every action, there is an equal but opposite reaction on a **different** object
- ⚠️ Forces in an action/reaction pair always act on **different** objects
- For every force on an object, there is a force of equal magnitude but opposite direction on some other object

## Weight
- $w=mg$
- If the only force acting on an object is due to gravity, the object is in **free-fall**
- there is **always** a weight force on an object, even when it is not accelerating (as long as $g\neq 0$)

## Mass vs Weight
|Mass|Weight|
|:--:|:--:|
|A measure of the **inertia** of an object (resistance to acceleration)|The magnitude of the gravitational **force** exerted on an object|
|**scalar**|**vector**|
|Depends only on 'amount of substance' in an object ($m$)|Depends on both the mass ($m$) and local acceleration due to gravity ($g$)|

## Spring Forces

## Hookes' Law
- $\vec{F_{sp}}=-k\Delta\vec{x}$
  - $F_{sp}$ = spring force
  - $k$ = spring constant
    - minus sign($-$) indicates that the spring force is always in the **opposite direction** to the extension or compression of the spring 
  - $\Delta \vec{x}$ = displacement

## Normal Forces
- Normal force exactly counter-balances weight forces so that objects don't fall through solids
  - ![](/src/assets/phyc10009/2021-03-11-12-27-04.png)
- Only solids have normal forces
  - ![](/src/assets/phyc10009/2021-03-11-12-29-23.png)
- Normal forces are perpendicular to surface

## Tension Forces
- Tension Force = force transmitted through a string or wire
  - ![](/src/assets/phyc10009/2021-03-11-12-36-46.png)
- Inextensible String Approximation
  - Assumes that the rope doesn't stretch at all
- Massless String Approximation
  - Assume that tension is equal throughout a rope/string

## Using Newton's Laws to Solve Problems
1. Identify the system of interest (which may include several objects)
2. Draw a diagram of the system of interest and its environment
3. 

## Equilibrium
### Static Equilibrium
- Net force on the object is zero and the object is stationary
### Dynamic Equilibrium
- Net force on the object is zero, and the object is moving at constant (non-zero) velocity

## Friction
- $\boxed{f\equiv \mu N}$
  - $f$ = friction
  - $\mu$ = coefficient of friction
    - depends on the characteristics of the surface that are in contact
    - no units
  - $N$ = normal force
  - still need to account for static and kinetic friction
- ![](/src/assets/phyc10009/2021-03-11-12-48-38.png)
- Friction is a force that **opposes** the motion past each other of objects that are *touching*
