I did a Bachelor of Science (major in Computing and Software Systems) and here are some notes I've gathered over the years. Hopefully they're useful to someone.

## Subjects

I basically filled my science electives with as many computing subjects possible and took breadths that I was interested in. I also did all of the hard computing subjects as early as possible (ie. doing Models of Computation in 2nd year instead of 3rd year) - not sure if I'd recommend it to everyone but it was nice to get them out of the way early to not stress about possibly failing a core subject in my final year.
